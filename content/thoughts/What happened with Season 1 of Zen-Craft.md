# Zen-Craft Season 1
## First creation

Originally I ran this server with a player called Kyg0z, someone who I used to play a modded server with some number of years ago. When I was slower working on this project and we hadn't had some contact for some time, I believe he, as well as perhaps another, had griefed the server. I noticed most accessible player builds had been griefed unfortunately, so I saved multiple iterations of the backups before creating Season2. If any user would like to have their content copied, I'll happily use WorldEdit to move your builds to Season2.

However, since most players had joined during this testing phase, and I'd only recently added these new item models as well, plus with all that other drama? I figure it might be time to just create a fresh world and get a claims plugin. Now users can protect their builds by designating regions with gold shovels instead of me cleaning up after someone decides to break things.

## Why it kinda sucked

Even though I was given moderation abilities and whatnot, that Kyg0z had never given me permissions to change anything about the Discord even though I had given them full panel access at the time to complete some configuration of plugins. When I had requested that be transferred, he wiped everything, so I can only assume that the same person (or perhaps a sibling?) was involved in the destruction of some of those builds. The first spawn was entirely from vanilla items. Aside from the bedrock we placed to designate the actual start, all blocks were mined and created by players, which is why that destruction was particularly disappointing. Nevertheless, it did cause me to build a separate hub server using the multiverse plugin, which turned out well if I do say so myself, especially with the new custom block models!

To be quite honest with you, I'm not going to model hundreds of individual block models while working on this website, the game, and the server. There's just no chance of that. So I spent around $160 on custom block models in order to just add them to the server with ItemsAdder, and it worked great. If you'd like to add your own custom models to the server, I certainly won't turn your help away!

## Where to get that map data

Season1 isn't entirely gone. After some weeks of inactivity, I downloaded the final backup and took it offline. You can request the data from me directly, but I hope you'll enjoy Season2 with these improvements! My apologies for not managing it better before as well. If I had set this up properly in the beginning, this likely would have been a better experience for the players who did join early. Thank you genuinely to all those who tolerated those conditions!
